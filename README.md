![Sticker - Danny's Diner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2aae3d5-199d-4ec5-bc37-e7629aedaea2)

This is a challenge to hone and prove my SQL capabilities.

# Introduction
Danny wants to use this data to answer a few simple questions about his customers. 

He plans on using answers from these questions to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Below are the key datasets for this study 

* [Sales](https://github.com/Rabulala7/Danny-s-Dinner-SQL-challenge/blob/main/datasets/Sales.csv)
* [Menu](https://github.com/Rabulala7/Danny-s-Dinner-SQL-challenge/blob/main/datasets/Menu.csv)
* [Members](https://github.com/Rabulala7/Danny-s-Dinner-SQL-challenge/blob/main/datasets/Members.csv)
